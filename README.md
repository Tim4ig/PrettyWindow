### PrettyWindow
This is a simple example of implementing WinAPI windows with Mica, Acrylic, or AltMica effects, supporting both dark and light themes.

This example demonstrates the creation of a window where you can draw using D2D1.
When I tried to recreate such windows, I encountered the issue of nothing being drawn.
I couldn't find a ready-made WinAPI C++ solution without WinRT on the internet, so I hope this will help you.
