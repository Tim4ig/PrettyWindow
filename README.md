### PrettyWindow
Example implementation of WinApi windows with Mica, Acrylic or AltMica effects, with a dark or light theme.

this is a simple example of creating such a window in which you can draw using d2d1,
when I wanted to repeat such windows I faced the problem that they do not get anything to draw,
I did not find a ready-made solution on the Internet, I hope this will help you.
